# translator
Graphical interface running on top of python and the Google Translate API.
## Using the source code
You'll need Python to run the source code. Download it for your OS here: https://www.python.org/
It should work with any version of Python 3.x, but it's only been tested on Python 3.9.

You will also need to install the following packages:
```
pip install calendar
pip install time
pip install datetime
pip install sys
pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0
```
Run the above commands in the command prompt. Make sure Python is added to PATH.
Note: many of these packages may come preinstalled. It's also important to install this exact version of googletrans as later versions don't support the same API for some reason.

## If you don't want the source code...
Head to releases and download.

## How to use
In the translate from and translate to fields, input the language code of your choice. You must input a language code: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages
You can use the little lightbulb button to toggle light and dark modes.
